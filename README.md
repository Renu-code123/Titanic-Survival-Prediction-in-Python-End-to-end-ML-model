<h1>🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – End-to-End ML Model</h1>

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline built using the famous Titanic dataset (Kaggle). It predicts passenger survival by performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation – all wrapped in a clean and reproducible workflow.

✨ Features
<br>

✅ Data Cleaning & Imputation – Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, etc.)
<br>
✅ Custom Transformers – Built using scikit-learn’s BaseEstimator & TransformerMixin
<br>
✅ Feature Engineering – One-hot encoding (Sex, Embarked), scaling, and feature selection <br>
✅ Pipeline Integration – Ensures consistent preprocessing for both train and test sets<br>
✅ Model Training – Random Forest Classifier with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning<br>
✅ Evaluation – Accuracy scores on train/test sets and insights into feature importance<br>
